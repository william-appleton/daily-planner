## Daily Planner

For this project a simple daily planner was built that utilized moment.js for time functions. This planner displays the current date at the top of the page, and shows text area inputs for each hour of the business day.

In each hour a clinet can write down whatever they wish for the hour, and then save that text using the button on the right. This saves the information so that even if the page is refreshed, the info will stay. Additionally, each hour is color coded according to whether it is in the past, present, or future, allowing the client to quickly where they are in their schedule.

The live application can be seen here at: https://william-appleton.github.io/daily-planner/

And here is a sample gif of the finished application: ![](https://github.com/william-appleton/daily-planner/blob/main/Assets/Work%20Day%20Scheduler.gif?raw=true)
